== Description ==

Helpi5 is a Saas tool that enables access to additional contents such as manual, support articles, documentation, etc.
at the click of a button. Without the need to travel to a redirected help desk, FAQ page,
or static external knowledge bases, customers get what they need, when they need it, right from their current webpage.

Help contents can be setup and personalized to every web page (based on url) using our intuitive online editor at helpi5.com

Our editor supports:

  + ###### Four types of Typography ranging in size and appearance:
    + Header Text
    + Paragraph Formatting
    + Regular Text
    + Links

  + ######Three types of Media content:
    + Images
    + Video
    + Maps

  + ###### Three types of structural components divided into:
    + One column
    + Two columns
    + Three columns

  + ###### Five main types of components that can also be used in your help page editing process:
    + *Alerts:* a thin coloured block with editable text that you can use between structural blocks to show a change in content or added remark.
    + *Badges:* a small circular block with editable text that can show a call to action or small piece of information.
    + *Accordion:* a dropdown type structure format in which you may include all types of text and media.
    + *Pill Tabs:* a tabular format that is completely editable. This structure may be used to create QnA-type format help pages.
    + *External Components:* this allows page creators to embed on-page visuals of external web pages of their choice.
